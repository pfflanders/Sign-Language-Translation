# Sign-Language-Translation
Github Repo focused on the translation of sign language using machine learning

Abstract
In 3-4 sentences, describe what problem the project addresses, and the overall approach you will use to solve that problem.

Planned Deliverables
Concisely state what you are aiming to create and what capabilities it will have. Are you making a webapp? A Python package for others to use? Code that creates a novel data set? Etc. Please consider two scenarios: - "Full success." What will your deliverable be if everything works out for you exactly as you plan? - "Partial success." What useful deliverable will you be able to offer even if things don't 100% work out? For example, maybe you aren't able to get that webapp together, but you can still create a code repository that showcases the machine learning pipeline needed to use to support the app. Have a contingency plan!

In each case, please make sure to be clear about what the interface is for your project. If you are making an app, then the interface should likely be either a local app or a webapp. If you are focusing on scientific computation or data science, then a Jupyter notebook may be an appropriate interface -- talk to me if you're not sure.

Resources Required
What resources do you need in order to complete your project? Data? Computing power? An account with a specific service?

Please pay special attention to the question of data. If your project idea involves data, include at least one link to a data set you can use. It's also acceptable to link to a website from which you intend to scrape the data you will use (although note that high-quality scraping is a lot of work).

If you can't find data for your original idea, that's ok! Think of something related to your group's interests for which you can find data.

Most projects should involve data in some way, but certain projects may not require data. Ask me if you're not sure.

Tools and Skills Required
What skills will you need? Machine learning, database management, complex visualization, something else? Do a bit of research into which Python packages accomplish the tasks you are going to need. Feel free to look ahead at what we're going to do in the remainder of the course -- you're likely to find some of the packages you'll need there!

What You Will Learn
What will you learn by completing this project? Feel free to mention particular techniques, software packages, version control, project management principles, any other learning goals you might have.

Risks
What are two things that could potentially stop you from achieving the full deliverable above? Maybe it turns out that the signal you thought would be present in the data just doesn't exist? Or maybe your idea requires more computational power than is available to you? What particular risks might be applicable for your project?

Ethics
All projects we undertake involve decisions about whose interests matter; which problems are important; and which tradeoffs are considered acceptable. Take some time to reflect on the potential impacts of your product on its users and the broader world. If you can see potential biases or harms from your work, describe some of the ways in which you will work to mitigate them. Remember that even relatively simple ideas can have unexpected and impactful biases. Here's a nice introductory video for thinking about these questions, and here's one that goes into somewhat more detail. Here are some relevant examples: - A recipe recommendation app can privilege the cuisines of some locales over others. Will your user search recipes by ingredients? Peanut butter and tomato might seem an odd combination in the context of European cuisine, but is common in many traditional dishes of the African diaspora. A similar set of questions applies to recommendation systems related to style or beauty. - A sentiment analyzer must be trained on specific languages. What languages will be included? Will diverse dialects be included, or only the "standard" version of the target language? Who would be excluded by such a choice, and how will you communicate about your limitations?

A related question is: should this app exist? In a few sentences, discuss the following questions:

What groups of people have the potential to benefit from the existence of our product?
What groups of people have the potential to be harmed from the existence of our product?
Will the world become an overall better place because of the existence of our product? Describe at least 2 assumptions behind your answer. For example, if your project aims to make it easier to predict crime, your assumptions might include:
Criminal activity is predictable based on other features of a person or location.
The world is a better place when police are able to perform their roles more efficiently.
Tentative Timeline
There will be checkpoints for the project at approximately two-week intervals. With this in mind, please describe what you expect to achieve after two, four, and six weeks. At each stage, you should have "something that works." For example, maybe in two weeks you'll ready to demonstrate the data acquisition pipeline, in four weeks you'll be able to demonstrate some data analysis, and in six weeks you'll have your full machine learning pipeline set up. Please keep in mind that you'll be asked to present at each of these checkpoints. Showing "something that works" will usually be necessary for full credit. The "something that works" idea is related to the common concept of "minimum viable products" in software development, and is visually illustrated here:
